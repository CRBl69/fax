# DrInFo

DrInFo stands for Drawing Information Format. It is a format that stores a
drawing by remembering how it was drawn.

## How it works

It is based on the following mechanisms :

- Everything is an instruction
- Image is stored as an ordered list of instructions
- Rendering is done by processing all of the instructions
- Instructions are saved per layer.

There is currently no global history, only per layer history. This means that
if you move a layer above an other, no history element will be created/saved,
and thus, you wont be able to undo (although you can just move the layer back).
A global history might be implemented in the future.

### Drawbacks

Storing images as instructions can be a good idea, but there are some drawbacks :

- Very long instruction lists can take forever to load/render
- File size can be infinite even for a fixed resolution

### Solutions

Here are some thoughts (that I might or might not implement in the future) that
I thought about in order to fix the above-mentioned problems, along with some
other drawbacks generated by the solutions :

- Render "steps", every `x` instructions, so that you never have to process more than `x` instructions in order to render a result
    - Significantly increases file size
    - Modifying an instruction at the beginning of the list makes all subsequent renders useless
- Truncate instructions at `y` (if we have 150 000 instructions, save the image at the 100 000 instructions state, and the last 50 000 instructions)
    - Loses access to infinite history
